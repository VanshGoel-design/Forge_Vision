This approach avoids unnecessary complexity. No authentication is required to submit the form, so all the data will be public. Therefore authorization independence is not applicable here, and no denormalization is needed, because there are not parent-child relationships and no concept of user-based data ownership or collaborative access. Segregation is not necessary, as there are no different access control requirements for form submissions."
