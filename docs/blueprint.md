# **App Name**: NeonEdge Portfolio

## Core Features:

- Hero Section with 3D Asset: Display a large headline, subtitle, and CTA button with a fullscreen Spline 3D asset in the background with subtle floating neon particles. Uses GSAP animations for fade-ins, CTA pulse on hover, and Spline fade-in from the right.
- About Us Section: Showcase group or abstract glowing avatars, a short bio with service highlights (Web Design, 3D Experiences, Modern UI/UX), and a grid of skill icons (HTML, CSS, JS, React, GSAP, Spline) with staggered fade-in and hover lift effects using GSAP.
- Projects Section: Implement a bento-style horizontal scroll layout with glassmorphic cards. Each card displays a project thumbnail, short description, and tech stack icons. Hover effect: card lifts and glows. Mobile: stack cards vertically, swipeable slider.
- Contact Section: Feature a sleek glowing form (Name, Email, Message) and social icons (GitHub, LinkedIn) with hover glow. A glowing neumorphic button scales/bounces on hover. Includes a direct contact popup button showing +91 9686545890.
- GSAP Loading Animation & Progress Bar: Create a fullscreen preloader screen with glowing text: 'Crafting the Future…'. Include a centered circular loader + progress bar filling from 0% → 100%. On complete, the progress bar fades out, the preloader scales and vanishes, and the Hero section fades in with motion.
- Footer: Implement a mini navigation with links and social media icons with a background of floating glowing particles and a GSAP fade-in slide-up animation.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Electric blue (#7DF9FF) to capture a futuristic and cutting-edge feel. This vibrant blue suggests innovation and technological prowess, essential for a modern web developer portfolio.
- Background color: Dark slate gray (#333333), desaturated for contrast.
- Accent color: Violet (#D09CFA), a slightly desaturated, luminous color analogous to the primary electric blue. This provides contrast and accentuates key interactive elements without overpowering the design.
- Font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for both headings and body text; bold headings and light body text create a clean, modern look.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for any displayed code snippets, monospaced.
- Use glowing neon icons related to web development technologies and skills.
- Cards: Glassmorphic, blurred with neon glow borders.
- Use soft shadows, blur-to-clear animations, and floating visuals throughout the website to enhance the immersive experience.
